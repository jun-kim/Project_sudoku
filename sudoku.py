#print_menu is supposed to print menu for the user. This is totally wrong use of the function.

def print_menu(sudoku):
  return 0

#instruction: Follow the instruction. You haven't done anything I put here. You just copy pasted other's code. Follow the instruction.
#1 . print the menu for sudoku user interface
#2 . print out a simple sudoku array. EX) 323 456 789
#                                         987 654 321 
#3 . change the array value using the menu. So use the menu to update a value. input 0 0 3 makes 1 -> 3
#4 . print menu prints updated sudoku array (regardless of correct or not)
